# Process

A process is a program in execution.

# Process Management

- Process management invloves managing the execution of multiple processes or tasks within the system. 
- process management involves managing the creation, scheduling, synchronization, and termination of these processes.

- The key functions of process management in an operating system include:

1. **Process creation:** The process manager creates new processes as required by the system or user requests.

2. **Process scheduling:** The process manager decides which process to execute next and allocates CPU time accordingly.

3. **Process synchronization:** The process manager ensures that multiple processes do not interfere with each other and that they can communicate and synchronize as needed.

4. **Process termination:** The process manager terminates processes that have completed their tasks or have exceeded their allocated resources.

5. **Memory management:** The process manager ensures that each process has access to the memory it needs and that memory is allocated efficiently.

6. **Resource allocation:** The process manager allocates system resources, such as CPU time and input/output devices, to each process according to their needs.

# Process State

- **New:** The process is being created.
- **Running:** Instructions are being executed.
- **Waiting:** The process is waiting for some event to occur (such as an I/O completion or reception of a signal).
- **Ready:** The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor.
- **Terminated:** The process has finished execution.
