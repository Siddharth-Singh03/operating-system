# What is Synchronization?

- Synchronization in operating systems refers to the coordination and management of concurrent processes or threads to ensure that they execute in a predictable and orderly manner.
- When multiple processes or threads access shared resources like memory, files, or I/O devices, there can be issues such as race conditions, deadlock, and livelock. Synchronization mechanisms are used to prevent or resolve these issues.
- Synchronization is an essential concept in operating systems, especially in multi-tasking environments, where multiple processes or threads can run simultaneously. By synchronizing their access to shared resources, synchronization mechanisms ensure the integrity of data, prevent inconsistencies, and improve the performance and efficiency of the system
